# Binance Futures Testnet Trading Bot

This is a command-line Python trading bot that interacts with the Binance Futures Testnet API to place Market and Limit orders. Built using the official `python-binance` library, it supports both buy and sell order types with proper input validation, logging, and error handling.

This project was developed as part of the application process for the Junior Python Developer – Crypto Trading Bot internship at PrimeTrade AI in collaboration with Bajarangs.
